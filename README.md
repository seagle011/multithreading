# multithreading

This program creates two Thread objects, t1 and t2, and starts them using the start() method. These threads then run in parallel, executing the print_numbers() and print_letters() functions respectively.

The join() method is then used to wait for both threads to complete before the program exits. This ensures that both threads have finished executing before the program terminates.

Therefore, the program creates and uses only two threads, one for each of the print_numbers() and print_letters() functions.
